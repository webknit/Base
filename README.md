♥ Base V2.1.0 ♥ 
===============

Features

If you've any questions feel free to contact me @webknit.


Gulp - Start Guide
--------

- Open command line
- Run 'npm install --global gulp'
- Run 'npm install' to install everything (might need sudo on mac)
- 'gulp' to run it


SASS Modules
-------------

The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS. Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.

- _variables.scss - Colours, Gradients, Typography
- _functions.scss - All the functions go in here
- _mixins.scss - All the mixins go in here


SASS Partials
-------------

The partials directory is where most of the CSS is constructed. Plan ahead and think how to structure these.

- _reset.scss - Reset, including HTML5
- _vendor.scss - The vendor directory is for third-party CSS
- _base.scss - All the base elements, HTML, body, container, headers, links, img, blockquote etc
- _buttons.scss - Button styles
- _forms.scss - Form styles
- _font-face.scss - Font face stuff
