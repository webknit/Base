/*

Settings – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.

Tools – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.

Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.

Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.

Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS

Components – specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components

Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class
